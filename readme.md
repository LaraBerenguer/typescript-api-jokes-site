# Typescript jokes generator with API calls

## 📄 Description

A joke generator built with TypeScript to practice API calls and asynchronous programming. This project fetches random jokes from an external API and displays them on the page. Users can rate each joke, and their ratings are stored for reference.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Typescript
- CSS
- Fetch API

## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- Typescript installed on your system.

**✔️ Step 1:** Install npm and project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

**✔️ Step 2:** Install typescript and project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm i -g typescript
```

**✔️ Step 3:** To compile your ts file to js while you work, run this:

```bash
tsc index.ts -w
```

## 📋 Optional step

Promises might throw an error like this in your debugger.

```bash
error TS2705: An async function or method in ES5 requires the 'Promise' constructor.
```
Consider installing node types to solve it.

```bash
npm install @types/node --save-dev
```
