# Typescript jokes generator with API calls

## üìÑ Description

Check it live here: https://typescript-api-jokes-site.vercel.app/

A joke generator built with TypeScript to practice API calls and asynchronous programming. This project fetches random jokes from an external API and displays them on the page. Users can rate each joke, and their ratings are stored for reference.

## üíª Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Typescript
- CSS
- Fetch API

## üîë Setting up .env configuration

To run this project, you need to configure environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open the .env file and replace your_api_key_here with your own API key from OpenWeather:

```bash
API_URL=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. If you don‚Äôt have an API key, create an account at OpenWeather and generate your key. [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

4. After setting up the .env file, you‚Äôll be ready to run the project.


## üìã Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- Typescript installed on your system.

- One of the features will cause the browser to ask for your location. It may not work on local host. Instructions on how to fix it below.


**‚úîÔ∏è Step 1:** Install npm and project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

**‚úîÔ∏è Step 2:** Install typescript and project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm i -g typescript
```

**‚úîÔ∏è Step 3:** To compile your ts file to js while you work, run this:

```bash
tsc index.ts -w
```

**‚úîÔ∏è Step 4:** Lauch your local host with the Live Server pluggin or running:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```
In the correct route path, run:

```bash
http-server
```
And then, select in your console the port you would like to use. It will look something like this:

```bash
Available on:
  http://10.63.1.79:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**‚úîÔ∏è Step 5** Make your location work in Local Host.

*For localhost only (Chrome 119 and above)*
Simply visit this link in your Chrome:

```bash
chrome://flags/#temporary-unexpire-flags-m118
```
You should see highlighted text saying:

```bash
Temporarily unexpire flags that expired as of M118. These flags will be removed soon. ‚Äì Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Android, Fuchsia, Lacros
```

Click Enable Then relauch Chrome.

*For localhost only (Chrome 118 and below)*
Simply visit this link in your Chrome:

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è‚Äã Optional step

Promises might throw an error like this in your debugger.

```bash
error TS2705: An async function or method in ES5 requires the 'Promise' constructor.
```
Consider installing node types to solve it.

```bash
npm install @types/node --save-dev
```
